And has a voice so divine
When he sings melodies
It’s like a dream so fine.

They faced many tests
Their disabilities turned into strengths
Stood out from the rest.

Ran fast with grace
Overcame polio 
Won every race.

And he captures the scene
His charisma and skills
Put him on the big screen.

Yet she found her way
To become a great artist
A painting legend today!

Blind and without sight 
His lovely music fulfilled.

The first blind person to summit
Could touch the blue sky.

A lawyer who is

A legacy built on 
the Cosmos’s vast land.

And with purpose and might
He fought for disability rights
All day and all night!

Our ten unique friends
Their stories of courage
